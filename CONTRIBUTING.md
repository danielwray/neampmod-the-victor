## Build Requirements

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: 1.92 or later (`rustup update stable`)
- **Cargo**: Comes with Rust installation
- **System Dependencies**:
  - CLAP and VST3 development headers (for plugin bundling)
  - See Dockerfile for dependencies

### Important Note: neampmod-engine Dependency

This plugin depends on `neampmod-engine`, which is not yet publicly available. You will **not be able to build** the plugin from source until the engine is released. However, you can still:
- Review the code for transparency and security
- Contribute improvements to the plugin-level code
- Report bugs and suggest features
- Improve documentation

When the engine is released, I will update the build instructions accordingly.
